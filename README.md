# IOT_Pattern_Analysis
Introduction:

This repository contains the code and documentation for a pattern analysis project implemented by a team of four members. The project aims to analyze patterns of motion using three MPU9250 sensors and an ESP32 module. The MPU9250 is a motion tracking device that combines a gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer, enabling accurate motion sensing.

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to track and analyze the movement patterns of an object or a person in a three-dimensional space. The three MPU9250 sensors are used to capture the orientation and acceleration data, which is then processed and analyzed by the ESP32 module.

Components Used:

3x MPU9250 Sensors<br>
ESP32 Development Board<br>
Connecting Wires<br>
Breadboard <br>

Features:

Motion tracking using MPU9250 sensors.<br/>
Data fusion from multiple sensors for enhanced accuracy.<br/>
Wireless data transmission to a central system for analysis.<br/>
Pattern recognition and analysis algorithms to identify specific movements.<br/>
